		Also contains makefile and the python test script named test.py

bin - The direcotry contains the object and excecutables of the codes.

doc - Contains the README.txt file and Documentation.pdf file
		Please read the Documentation.pdf file for further instructions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code has been tested via both the given python test script and individual commands. Both the methods return successful 
outputs. Various other commands given in the assignment sheet were also tested and produced correct outputs.

In cases of invalid commands, the server displays an output saying it was an invalid command and there is no reply to the
client. Hence nothing is displayed on the client terminal.
